# Forge Fire Website

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app). It also features [React Bootstrap](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/) to make design a bit more straightforward.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

## Posts
Markdown files in the `_posts` directory are loaded as posts on the website. Currently it loads the 3 most recent posts for display on the home page. 

## Configuration
The repository includes a small config file to edit some of the links. It is located in `libs/configs`.
